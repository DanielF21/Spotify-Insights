## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js for a responsive and dynamic user interface
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth for secure user authentication ([Documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth))
- **Data Storage**: Supabase for efficient data management
- **API Integration**: Spotify Web API for accessing music data and user information

## Authentication
